Parenting my son initially felt like navigating through a relentless blur. Juggling work and the unfolding challenges of raising a child with special needs left me with scarcely a moment to breathe. Then, the pandemic brought everyday life to a standstill, halting my career and thrusting me into the role of a stay-at-home mom (SAHM). This unwelcomed and unplanned shift forced me to confront a harsh truth: I was exhausted. Caught in a relentless pace, I realized this cycle threatened both my family's well-being and my personal aspirations.

Yet, within this pause lay an unexpected gift—a much-needed reset. It afforded me the time to reflect, plan, and envision various futures, revealing a desire to fully transition into Product Management. This introspection led me to two profound truths: the skills developed from parenting a child with special needs—like adaptability and an appreciation for my son's unique perspective—were not just vital for his development but had become integral to my professional evolution as a product manager.

These insights propelled me toward a deeper understanding of Human-Centered Product Design, underscoring that effective product management fundamentally relies on embracing diverse perspectives and leveraging these insights to create products that truly meet user needs.

Navigating the shift from traditional parental expectations to addressing the constant demands of my son’s special educational needs taught me invaluable lessons in product flexibility. As a Product Manager, this experience sharpened my ability to observe and adapt to market trends, ensuring our product roadmap remained relevant and responsive.

Moreover, in moments where communication with my son was limited or unclear, I learned the importance of prioritizing behavior over words. This insight, directly transferable to product management, highlighted the significance of observing user behavior and understanding their underlying needs before crafting solutions.

This journey has expanded my vision beyond myself, transforming me into not only a better parent but also a more insightful and compassionate Product Manager. These experiences have paved a path for continuous growth, influencing how I approach challenges and seize opportunities, both at home and within the workplace, armed with empathy and a mindset geared toward innovation and inclusivity.

As I continue my parenting journey, my curiosity and excitement grow, eager to discover how much more my son will influence my personal and professional development.

My son stood surveying the mini brand toys; with birthday money in his wallet, he declared, “These prices are outrageous!” disappointed his money wouldn’t stretch as far as he hoped. I reminded him that he had a choice on how to spend his money and left him to ponder. After a moment, he decided to seek out something he felt offered more value for his money.

I am grateful for his unnaturally loud outbursts; hearing his voice is a vivid reminder of a time when I was told he might never engage in conversation. Yet, today, in the middle of a store, he voiced his frustration, considered his options, and made his own decision independently. I am fortunate for the combination of dedicated educators and technology, which has enabled him to communicate his feelings quite effectively, despite his occasional reluctance to listen to others.

This sense of gratitude deepens, especially when I recall his initial aversion to any form of direct interaction. Simple activities that many take for granted could trigger significant distress for him. For instance, singing the alphabet, which should have been a bonding experience, instead drove him to either flee with his ears covered or, in rare instances, attempt to silence me by covering my mouth. His world was marked by silence, a silence that seemed impenetrable, with every attempt at interaction met with a physical display of discomfort.

The turning point came with the introduction of technology, particularly educational apps like Endless Alphabet. The iPad transformed from a mere device to a portal of discovery, opening up learning opportunities that had previously seemed beyond reach. His engagement with the app, his laughter at the animations, and his willingness to interact with the letters marked the beginning of his journey toward communication. Sometimes, he would invite me to join in the fun, allowing us to explore the letters together on the screen. This shared experience was more than educational; These moments watching Letter Dance in a colorful frenzy allowed us to have an enjoyable parent and-child connection, the technology significantly reduced stress for both of us, and fostered a unique bond that I had once feared might never develop.

Technology has been a pivotal part of my son's life and education, complemented by the unwavering support of the Florida Diagnostic and Learning Resource System (FDLRS) and dedicated local educators. Their expertise and guidance have been indispensable, especially when navigating the complexities of his educational needs. When it became apparent that one school could not provide the necessary support, they directed us toward alternatives that, though initially daunting, proved to be exactly what he needed.

This collaborative effort between educators and technology has been fundamental to his success. As we now look towards new tools like ChatGPT and Khan Academy’s AI tutor, Khanmigo, I am cautiously optimistic. These innovations hold the promise of further enhancing his education with personalized experiences. However, this journey has underscored the critical importance of maintaining a balance between leveraging technology and fostering the invaluable human connections that are essential for learning and development.

As we continue to navigate the future of education and technology, it is clear that the question is not solely about what we teach these models, but also about how we ensure that technology enriches human bonds, particularly between parents and children. It's these connections, strengthened by shared experiences and mutual discoveries, that form the cornerstone of our hope and vision for the future.

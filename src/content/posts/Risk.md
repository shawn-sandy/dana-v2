In November 2022, I was brimming with excitement. I had a family vacation right around the corner, I was thriving in a job where I collaborated with a team as passionate as I was about creating and improving products, and I was beginning to master work-life balance. However, as layoffs began, mirroring the fate of many other corporations, my job vanished by November 18th. My instinct was to update my resume and start anew—I've always focused on moving forward rather than dwelling on setbacks. Yet, my husband suggested I pause to genuinely consider what I wanted to do next.

Knowing what I wanted wasn't the challenge, during the pandemic I had time for and it had given me clarity on my personal goals, this was a new opportunity. An opportunity to refine my goals. So what did I want? I wanted to be a Product Manager, who created a product that makes a difference, but  I also wanted quality time to send off my children to school and be present and available for their needs, I wanted the energy to engage in school and community events, and to explore volunteer opportunities.

A thought crossed my mind that perhaps my aspirations were overly ambitious. Yet, in a moment that felt like either pure genius or complete madness, I pondered, "Why not pursue it all?"—starting my organization with a focus on building educational products. It would satisfy all my needs.  From November through January, I avoided rushing into decisions. Instead, I discussed countless plans with my husband. In February, after presenting another iteration of my idea, he gave me the push I needed: “You can do it, but you have to choose and commit to it.”

Receiving my husband's support and the liberty to choose my next steps initially felt overwhelming. As a mother, I had always looked for efficient, safe paths. This time, however, I was encouraged to embrace some risks. Yet, I couldn't help but imagine dramatic scenarios: losing a second income could jeopardize our financial security, possibly leading to homelessness, or developing a product that no one wants could prevent me from securing employment again due to my age.

I recognized this downward spiral and decided to reassess my situation. I reminded myself that my layoff resulted from economic conditions and a company merger, which in itself was proof that proving that job security is an illusion. Embracing flexibility, especially with my son growing older, I realized that being my boss would allow me to tailor my schedule. This flexibility would enable me to be more available and work closely with his educators, to be able to guide and support my children during critical aspects of their educational and personal journeys.

Moreover, with one child on the spectrum, this path would afford me the time to explore alternative educational methods through technology, like augmented reality (AR), and now AI, more deeply.

Reconnecting with the motivations behind my ambitions reignited my determination. Pushing through the paralysis by analysis, I took the first step toward realizing my dreams.
